*Nearly 100 years have passed since the discovery of Psychomechanics changed everything. The impact left the world in a fracas, and those brave enough have turned the dark pit of the impact into Yggdrasil, a paradise in the heart of the weird, and the capital of the esoteric science.*

*But unknown sciences rarely stay chained. It is now 2032. The world has grown cruel, cold, and bitter. The Bend is open. An extraplanar threat calling itself the "Banshee" is pouring in. Reality appears to be tearing apart at the seams. The math is hard and simple: If we can't save Yggdrasil, humanity is lost.*

*With little support and nowhere to run, it falls to you, one of the last of the elite "Psichonauts," to stop the Banshee and save a reality on the brink of collapse.*

**Will you Reign in Chaos?**

**Bendgame** is an exciting Action RPG where style is king, suffering is the point, and there's no wrong way to win a fight. Embrace emergent mechanics and fight your way to victory, and Reign in Chaos.

Bendgame Launches in 2024. Visit [bendgame.com](https://bendgame.com) for more details.
