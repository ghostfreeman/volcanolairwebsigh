## Compensation
95-105k Annually depending on location, skillset, and other factors.

Volcano Lair provides comprehensive benefits including Health and Life insurance, AD&D, 401k, 15 PTO days a year (unlimited PTO is a scam and we hate it too), 20 sick days, COVID leave, 6 months maternity leave (for both parents after 1 year of employment) and much more.
