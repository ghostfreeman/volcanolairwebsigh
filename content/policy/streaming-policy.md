You are free to record, share, perform, or stream video footage, still images, and footage with audio from Volcano Lair games for your own purposes, either for or not for profit; regardless of whether or not it constitutes any definition of "fair use". We're cool like that.

If for some reason you need a written consent, [contact us](/contact).
