# The Long Version

## Respect

The Volcano Lair Discord (henceforth the “**Discord**”) is an encouraging community dedicated to high quality shitposting around Volcano Lair, its products, and the fandoms that entail. The Discord is an inclusive environment based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of gender or gender identity (including transgender status), sexual orientation, age, disability, nationality, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political affiliation, or career path.

We value respectful behavior above individual opinions.

Respectful behavior includes but is not limited to:

* Be considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
* Avoiding demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
* Avoiding imagery, language, and behavior that may be seen as graphic, violent, sexist, racist, hate speech, promoting fascism or fascist ideologies, homophobic, or transphobic.
* Avoid behavior that may be seen as encroaching on one’s privacy or agency, e.g. stalking.
* Respecting or exercising due regard for the feelings, wishes, rights, and traditions of others.
* Arguing on ideas and topics, not people.

Disrespectful behavior includes but is not limited to:

* Verbal harassment in any form of community members.
* Written harassment including on any electronic media or communication channel.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.
* Otherwise being disrespectful to others.
* Violent threats or language directed against another person.
* Sexual language and imagery in any communication channel.
* Harassing photography or recording.
* Racist, homophobic, or transphobic speech or ideals.
* Promoting fascist speech or ideals (with the exception to inform, educate, or entertain; this distinction shall be made by the Moderation Team).
* Defaming individuals based on a previous or unacknowledged name or gender, aka "deadnaming."
* Intentionally disclosing personally identifying information on another user without their consent, aka "doxing."
* Sustained disruption of voice chats, video chats, talks or other events.
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

**Members asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.**

If you're unclear if a communication, action, or behavior is respectful, ask someone instead of assuming. No, really. Just ask the Moderators and Administrators (henceforth the “**moderation team**") publicly or privately. We'd rather hear from you than hear about something you said or did after the fact, and we are here to help.

Don't be a bystander, be a leader. Role model respectful behavior, but also help to address disrespect when you see it within your community.

These policies also extend to usernames.

**The Bottom Line**: We believe in [being excellent to each other](https://youtu.be/S67sDHdhpio?t=79) above all things. We encourage everyone to be respectful and mindful, and to have fun in the community. Disrespectful behavior by active members may be considered a violation of this code of conduct at the moderation teams’ discretion.

## Privacy

This community is not a public space. However, no one has signed an non-disclosure agreement (“NDA”) to participate, and you should not presume anything you say here will remain private, so act accordingly. Protect IP and legally-protected information.

Topics relating to Volcano Lair projects that are not intended or authorized for public discussion are not permitted, either.

For attribution of specific content found on this Discord, we ask that you ask the originator of the content for permission.

## Read the Room

Once onboard, you will likely find yourself in a popular channel with many members who sound like we've figured it out. These are lies made up by the absolutely deranged because [we think we know what we’re doing](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/114/873/meh.ro4758.jpg). While advice on one channel might read definitive, it is one member's lessons interpretation and learning from their experiences. While there is a diverse set of experiences within this community, we continue to learn at every level of expertise. What is taboo one day may be gratis the next.

Different channels have organically developed distinct personalities. Before posting in a channel with hundreds of members, we suggest you take the time to read the room. Specifically:

* Read the last couple of days of messages.
* Examine the channel topic for helpful tips.
* Click on the channel details and read the about section to see how many members are present, what messages have already been pinned, and what files have been shared.

**The Bottom Line**: Posting the same message to multiple channels is spamming. Don't spam.

## Languages

We are always flattered to see people all around the world playing our games. However, unless the channel explicitly states any other language is permitted, all channels should use the English language. Use your own discretion in this regard.

If you think we should have additional channels for other languages, let the moderation team know.

## Age Restrictions

Due to safety regulations, and the maturity and graphicness of content produced by the company, we do not allow any user under the age of 17 to be active on the Discord. Anyone under the age of 17 will be barred from accessing the Discord.

## User Generated Content

We welcome the community to create fan content based on our works in the manner they feel it would best express themselves. There are expectations that in order for our Discord to remain a safe and visible space for all parties.

Therefore, user generated content that is clearly explicit in either a graphic, violent, or sexual nature, or otherwise in a manner that would make it inappropriate for public spaces (a.k.a. “Not Safe For Work,” **NSFW**) is not permitted on the Discord. The moderation team have sole judgement to rule if this content is allowed or not.

**The Bottom Line**: We welcome user generated content, but we do not welcome NSFW content. [Go be horny somewhere else](https://i.imgur.com/DxEqStK.mp4).

## Slow Mode

Some channels will have Slow Mode enabled to prevent them from becoming cesspits. Remember to read the room when contributing to these channels, and don't use shadow edits to make a point. Using shadow edits or other means to circumvent slow mode will be disciplined accordingly.

## Discussion about Games

We welcome discussions about our games in their appropriate channels. As the nature of media consumption has changes in the age of binge-watching, there is always the chance that story elements from one title may be new to other people. For this reason, please respect if a channel has a moratorium on discussing story elements (‘spoilers’) and use channels that clearly specify if these story elements can be discussed in the open. This will almost always be indicated with `-spoilers` at the end of channel name. It goes without saying, but if you choose to visit one of these channels, you alone are entirely liable for your own exposure to such content.

Intentionally disclosing story elements outside of a designated channel, or a DM, regardless of solicitation or intent, is grounds for disciplinary action.

## Direct Message Etiquette

A direct message ("DM") is a private message to one or more other members. Sending a DM to another member you don't know might be jarring for the receiver. Before sending a DM to a member you've never contacted, consider the following:

* Is it obvious to the other member why I am contacting them privately? If not, should I provide context, such as a public post?
* Could this message be considered unsolicited spam? If so, should you be sending it?

**The Bottom Line**: Unsolicited DMs are likely Code of Conduct violations, especially with a commercial flavor.

## Not For Profit (Mostly)

This community straight up dislikes unwanted commercial behavior. This is not a place for prominent commercial activities such as recruiting, lead generation, marketing, CD key selling, piracy, affiliate shops, crypto, trading, auctioning, and other solicitation, except in channels dedicated to that purpose (if such channels exist). If you join this community to take value rather than contribute, the community will quickly notice and react.

While apparent commercial behavior is easy to identify, non-obvious commercial behavior is a grey area. In general, if you are wondering if a post is commercially appropriate, our guidelines are that you:

* Ask permission of the channel before posting a message that might be considered commercial, stating clear intent for the post, and,
* Listen to the response of your peers in the channel and act accordingly.

If, after engaging with the community, you are still wondering if a specific message is commercial or not, please ask in one of the channels dedicated to helping find their way in this community.

### The Bottom Lines

* Emailing members with unsolicited commercial offers based on information acquired within the community is a Code of Conduct violation.
* Selling of CD keys or links to grey area merchants like G2A is a Code of Conduct violation.
* Discussion of piracy of any games, let alone ours, is a Code of Conduct violation.
* Aggressive spamming is a Code of Conduct violation.

## Don't Be a Troll

A troll is a member who starts flame wars or intentionally upsets other members by posting inflammatory, digressive, extraneous, or off-topic messages to provoke members into displaying emotional responses and normalizing tangential discussion either for the troll's amusement or a specific gain.

The determination of whether a message is trolling is often a subjective assessment by the moderation team, but there is a specific situation where the Discord has a zero-tolerance policy where:

1. A message which is perceived and reported as trolling,
2. Is posted by a non-contributing member with little to no other engagement elsewhere in the Discord, and, 
3. Is posted via a deliberately fake account.

Content posted in this fashion results in a no-warning ban of the offending account from the Discord. Trolling which does not meet this high bar is managed via the usual content review process.

### The Bottom Lines

* The moderation team may delete messages that violate the Code of Conduct.
* In non-trolling cases, the authors of those messages will be notified and may be given a chance to modify the message themselves.

## Content Review Process

The moderation team may come across or be notified of content or conduct violating the Code of Conduct. In some situations, this may lead to the moderation team deleting the message (or messages) that violate the CoC. Messages most likely to be deleted are commercial solicitations, disrespectful messages to other members, or links to disturbing or distressing content without appropriate measures to warn of or hide the content (including image uploads and unfurls).

Ideally, another Discord member notices this content and contacts the original poster, who then modifies or deletes the message so that it is no longer problematic. In this case, no further moderation team action is required. Suppose action is desired due to lack of response or any other reason. In that case, the moderation team will notify the original poster of the violation and the need to reword or remove the problematic message. The moderation team will also specify a time after which moderation action will be taken to delete the content if it is not addressed. This time may be as little as a few minutes or as much as 24 hours.

The determination of how much time is allowed is up to the moderation team, but the following context will be used to help determine the time before the moderation team’s action:

* How blatant the violation is
* How likely it is to be seen by others (higher-volume channels get less time)
* How likely it is to trigger negative reactions in others

## Resolve Peacefully

As a leadership community, we believe peer-to-peer discussions, feedback, and corrections can help build a stronger, safer, more informed, and more welcoming community.

If you see someone violating any part of this Code of Conduct, we urge you to respectfully dissuade them from such behavior using specifics from this document as guidelines. Expect that others in the community wish to help keep the community respectful and welcome your input.

If you experience disrespectful behavior toward yourself or anyone else and feel unable or unwilling to respond or resolve it respectfully (for any reason), please immediately bring it to the attention of the moderation team. We want to hear from you about anything that you feel is disrespectful, threatening, or just something that could make someone feel distressed. We will listen and work to resolve the matter with your help promptly.

Should you catch yourself behaving disrespectfully, or be confronted as such, listen intently, own up to your words and actions, and apologize accordingly. No one is perfect, and even well-intentioned people make mistakes. How you handle them and avoid repeating them in future matters. We are always growing in some shape or form, and all monsters can become beautiful.

## Additional Situations

If you cannot resolve a situation peacefully, please contact the moderation team as the need arises.

Suppose the moderation team determine that a member is violating any part of this Code of Conduct. In that case, they may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion and exclusion from the Discord.

As the moderation team, we will seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and in a manner that is positive for the community. This Code of Conduct documents everyday situations we've seen, but we can't foresee every situation. If in the moderation team's judgment, the best thing to do is to ask a disrespectful individual to leave, we will do so.

## Moderation Team

### Contacting the Moderation Team

The moderation team can be contacted at any time in the #mod-help Discord channel, by sending a direct message to them via Discord, through the Contact Form on the [Contact](/contact) page, or by email at `discord at volcanolair dot co`.

If for some reason you do not feel comfortable contacting a Moderator and want to contact an administrator directly, contact them through the `discord at volcanolair dot co` email and clarify in your message that the matter is meant solely for an administrator, or DM an administrator directly via Discord.

### Moderators

Moderators (or **Psichonauts**) are community members who serve at the pleasure of Volcano Lair in an unpaid capacity.

The Moderators are as of February 2023:

* 

The administrators will solicit, recruit, and vet moderators at our own discretion.

### Administrators

Administrators (or **Masterminds**) are employees of Volcano Lair LLC.

The Administrator(s) of the Discord as of January 2023:

* @kingthrillgore#1400 (Volcano Lair Managing Director)

### Escalation of Moderation Team Actions

Moderator and Administrator actions escalate from least severe to most severe:

* We ask you nicely to stop
* We ask you to stop in a less friendly tone
* Revocation of privileges on the server
* Removal of comments and content
* Temporary Ban for 1-14 days
* Permanent Ban (“perma’d”) from the Discord

The moderation team reserve their judgement to use less or severe punishment as the needs arise.

Using mechanisms to avoid, dodge, evade, or route around a ban, such as but not limited to creating a new account, co-opting another account, or using an intermediary account, is grounds for an immediate and unappealable permaban.

### Redress of Grievances and Appeal

Due to the nature of running an online community, we cannot guarantee the right of appeal on decisions made by the moderation team. That said, we believe that community moderation is a two-way street, and questions about offending content or behavior will be addressed by us directly, and by the same extent, discussions about the level of disciplinary actions committed by the moderation team. We would rather you come to us first, than ask for forgiveness later.

## Updates to this policy

This policy can be updated at any time as the moderation team deems fit. We will always keep you informed of updates, as quickly as possible.
